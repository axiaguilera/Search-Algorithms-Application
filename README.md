# Analytical Problem Formulation and Search Algorithms Application

This project explores two classic problems - the Shortest Path Problem with Obstacles and the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem. The project focuses on the analytical formulation of the problems, the design of suitable state spaces, and the application of appropriate search algorithms to solve them.

**Objectives:**

1. **Shortest Path Problem with Obstacles**
    - Define the state space of all positions (x,y) in the plane, compute the number of states and paths to the goal.
    - Explain why the shortest path from one polygon vertex to any other must consist of straight-line segments joining some of the vertices of the polygons.
    - Redefine a more efficient state space and calculate its size.
    - Define the necessary functions to implement the search problem, including a function that returns a set of vectors mapping the current vertex to reachable vertices.
    - Apply appropriate search algorithms to solve a range of problems in this domain and evaluate their performance.

2. **Missionaries and Cannibals Problem**
    - Formulate the problem precisely, ensuring a valid solution, and draw a diagram of the complete state space.
    - Implement and solve the problem optimally using a suitable search algorithm, considering whether checking for repeated states is beneficial.
    - Analyze why people have difficulty solving this puzzle, given the simplicity of the state space.

**Methodology:**

- Begin with a thorough understanding and analytical formulation of both problems.
- For the Shortest Path Problem, define the state space and necessary functions for the search problem. Apply and evaluate suitable search algorithms.
- For the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem, precisely formulate the problem and construct the state space diagram. Implement an optimal search algorithm and evaluate its performance.
- Reflect on the challenges and possible cognitive limitations that make the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem difficult for humans to solve.

**Expected Outcomes:**

This project will result in a detailed exploration of the Shortest Path Problem with Obstacles and the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem. It aims to demonstrate the power of analytical problem formulation and the application of search algorithms in solving such problems. A reflection on human cognitive limitations in problem-solving will also provide interesting insights.
